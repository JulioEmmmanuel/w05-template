# DevOps W05 In-Class Exercise Template

This repository contains a full-stack application with a SvelteKit client and a Spring Boot server. It demonstrates modern web application architecture and DevOps practices.

## Project Overview

This project includes:
- **Client**: SvelteKit with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and reusable UI components.
- **Server**: Spring Boot Java application with RESTful APIs.
- **DevOps**: Dockerized services, CI/CD pipelines, and production-ready deployment configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or later)
- Java JDK 21+
- Gradle
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/w05-template.git
cd w05-template
```

### Client Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Running the Application

### Start the Client

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
The client will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Start the Server

```bash
cd server
./gradlew bootRun
```
The server API will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Development Workflow

### Client Development

- Built with SvelteKit and TypeScript for a modern, reactive UI.
- TailwindCSS for styling.
- Components and routes are organized in the `src` directory.

### Server Development

- Built with Spring Boot for scalable and maintainable server services.
- Gradle is used for dependency management and building.
- Source code is in the `src/main/java` directory.
- Tests are in the `src/test/java` directory.

## Building for Production

### Client Build

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Server Build

```bash
cd server
./gradlew clean build
```

## Dockerized Deployment

The project includes Docker configurations for containerized deployment.

### Build and Run with Docker Compose

1. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
2. Access the application:
   - Client: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Server: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for:
- **Building Docker Images**: Automatically builds and pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry.
- **Deploying Docker Images**: Deploys the application to a production environment using Docker Compose.
